# Cryptography Scavenger Hunt

### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

*Hint: Make full use of Github's website functions to find hidden clues*
### Puzzle 1: Caesar Cipher Decryption
You will be given 2 sentences that has been encrypted using a caesar cipher. The first one will be accompanied by the shift number, which should make decryption a lot easier. The second, however, will not come with a key.

```python
ciphertext1 = ""  # Key = 17
ciphertext2 = ""
```

<!--Hint: ciphertext1 is something that we did earlier, ciphertext2 can be solved with a for loop and some printing-->

### Puzzle 2: Substitution Cipher Encryption
You will be given 3 words or phrases that need to be encrypted using the substitution cipher. Come up with a key for each plaintext that will convert them to the expected ciphertext

```python
plaintext1 = "We will stirke Venice"    # Expected ciphertext: 
plaintext2 = "Server shutdown"          # Expected ciphertext: 
plaintext3 = "Build the fort"           # Expected ciphertext: 
```

<!-- Hint: the first two plaintext strings should be encrypted using keys that are in-order -->

### Puzzle 3: Name the cipher
You will be given two encrypted strings. Your job is to figure out 

```python
plaintext1 = ""  # Caesar cipher
plaintext2 = ""  # Random substitution cipher
```
